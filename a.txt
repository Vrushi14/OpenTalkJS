Here's a poem about nature:

In twilight's hush, where shadows play,
The forest whispers secrets of the day.
The trees stand tall, their leaves a-glow,
A soft susurration, as the wind does flow.

The river's voice, a gentle song,
Echoes through the valley all day long.
The water's edge, a canvas wide,
Reflecting skies, and a world outside.

The sun sets low, with fiery glow,
Painting the horizon, in hues that grow.
The stars appear, like diamonds bright,
Twinkling in the night, with all their light.

In nature's beauty, we find our peace,
A sense of calm, that our souls release.
So let us wander, through her verdant heart,
And listen to the whispers, of the earth.

For in nature's splendor, we are not alone,
Connected by threads, that bind us home.
We are part of a web, that stretches wide,
A tapestry rich, with colors inside.
