In forests deep, where trees preside,
A gentle breeze whispers, side by side.
The rustling leaves, a soft delight,
As sunbeams filter, through morning light.

The river flows, a winding stream,
Through rocks and trees, a soothing dream.
Its waters lap, at riverbed so fine,
Reflecting sky, in shimmering shine.

In mountains high, where peaks touch the air,
Snowflakes dance, with delicate care.
Their fragile beauty, pure and bright,
A fleeting wonder, of morning light.

The ocean's roar, a constant sound,
Ebbing and flowing, all around.
Seagulls soar, on wind currents high,
As waves caress, the sandy sky.

In twilight's hush, where shadows play,
Nature's tapestry, in shades gray.
The stars appear, like diamonds bright,
A celestial show, on this quiet night.

Yet, even in darkness, there's still life,
A spark of magic, deep inside.
For in the night, when all is still,
The moon's pale glow, a gentle will.
