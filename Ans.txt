In twilight's hush, where shadows play,
The forest whispers secrets of the day.
The trees, like sentinels of old,
Stand guard, their branches swaying to and fro.

The wind, a gentle lover's sigh,
Stirs through the leaves, a soft goodbye.
The sun, a burning ember low,
Casts golden light upon the snow.

The river flows, a silver stream,
Through valleys green, where wildflowers beam.
The water's voice, a soothing sound,
Echoes through the trees, all around.

In this still world, where nature reigns,
We find our peace, and calm, and refrains.
From mountains high to valleys low,
Nature's beauty touches, and forever glows.

So let us cherish, this land of ours,
And all its wonders, pure and fresh.
For in its heart, we'll find our home,
And in its depths, a love that will roam.
