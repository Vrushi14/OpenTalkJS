**Q1. Short Story Plot**

Title: The Last Leaf

Plot Idea:
In a small village nestled in the heart of an ancient forest, the last leaf falls from the majestic tree that has stood tall for centuries. As it drifts away, it carries with it memories of seasons past and whispers of the villagers' collective hopes and fears. When the leaf arrives in a distant city, it sparks a journey of self-discovery and connection, forcing the protagonist to confront the changing world and her place within it.

**Q2. Poem about Nature**

"Whispers of the Woods"

In twilight's hush, where shadows play
The trees whisper secrets, night and day
Their leaves rustle, soft and low
As ancient wisdom only whispers slow

The wind stirs, a gentle breeze
That carries scents of earthy ease
The forest floor, a carpet deep
Where creatures roam, in silence keep

The moon above, a glowing orb
Illuminates the forest's lore
A time for dreams, for magic to seep
Into the hearts of those who softly creep

In nature's arms, we find our peace
A sense of belonging to the release

This poem aims to evoke a sense of calm and connection with nature, exploring themes of serenity and the mysteries that lie within the natural world.
