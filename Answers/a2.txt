**Short Story Plot**

Title: The Last Leaf

Plot Idea:
In a world where time has stopped, a young woman named Aria discovers that she is the last living heir of a long-lost civilization that once thrived on Earth. As she embarks on a journey to find others like her, she must navigate through a desolate landscape filled with remnants of a forgotten past.

As Aria travels, she encounters other survivors who possess unique abilities and knowledge from their lost culture. Together, they form a small community, but Aria's presence sparks a debate about the nature of humanity and what it means to be alive.

**Poem: Nature**

The earth exhales slow and deep,
A sigh of relief, a quiet sleep.
The trees stand tall, their branches wide,
A canopy above, a peaceful tide.

The wind whispers secrets, soft and low,
As petals fall, like tears from below.
The sun rises high, a burning flame,
Warming the skin, and soothing the pain.

The river flows, a winding stream,
Through mountains steep, and valleys serene.
Its waters crystal clear, a mirror's face,
Reflecting nature's beauty, in every place.

In this poem, I aimed to capture the serenity and majesty of nature. The language is simple yet evocative, with imagery that invites the reader to immerse themselves in the natural world. The poem explores the themes of renewal, peace, and the interconnectedness of all living things.
